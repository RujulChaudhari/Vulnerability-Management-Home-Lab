# Home Lab Setup Guide

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a home lab for hands-on learning about vulnerability scanning and remediation. The lab will include a virtual machine (VM) with intentionally vulnerable configurations, and we will use Nessus, a popular vulnerability scanner, to identify and fix these vulnerabilities.

### Prerequisites

- A computer with Hyper-V active (can be done in VirtualBox too)
- Basic understanding of virtualization concepts
- Internet connection

## Step 1: Create a Vulnerable VM in Hyper-V

1. Open Hyper-V Manager on your host machine.
2. Create a new [Windows virtual](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2022) machine and follow the wizard to set up basic configurations (e.g., name, location, memory, network).
3. Once the VM is setup, go ahead and boot it up.

## Step 2: Inside the VM
1. Once the VM is up, go to the Windows Defender Firewall.

3. Click on "Windows Defender Firewall Properties", and disable the firewall for "Domanin Profile", "Private Profile", and "Public Profile".
4. Once that is done, you should now be able to ping your VM from the host machine.




## Step 2: Install Nessus

1. Download and install Nessus on your host machine from the [official website](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus).
2. Follow the installation wizard, and make note of the activation code provided.
3. Once you reach this part, you want to select "Nessus Essentials" as your service.

4. It will start Initalizing. This might take a bit, so be paitent.

## Step 3: Configure Nessus

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:8834`.
2. Log in with the credentials created during the Nessus installation.
3. Activate Nessus using the provided activation code.
4. Once you've activated nessus, you will see the "My Scans" tab, go ahead and click on it.
5. Here you will see a option to "Create a new scan", so ahead and select that. This will display several scanning options. For the sake of this turorial you want to select the "Basic Network Scan" option.
6. Here we want to enter a name for the scan, and select who the target is. For the target, you want to put in the Ip of the VM we created.

7. You want to select "Port Scan (all ports)"
8. Once you've done that, your going to click on the Credentials tab. There you will enter your local admin credentials that you have on the VM.
9. Once everthing has been entered your going to hit "Save"

## Step 4: Perform Vulnerability Scan

1. In the Nessus web interface, create a new scan.
2. Configure the scan settings, targeting your vulnerable VM's IP address.
3. Start the scan and wait for it to complete.

## Step 5: Analyze Scan Results

1. Review the Nessus scan results to identify vulnerabilities on your VM.
2. Prioritize the vulnerabilities based on their severity.

## Step 6: Remediate Vulnerabilities

1. Access your vulnerable VM and begin addressing the identified vulnerabilities.
2. Install updates, patches, or remove deprecated software to secure the VM.
3. Re-run the Nessus scan periodically to track your progress.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a home lab, performed a vulnerability scan using Nessus, and worked on remediating vulnerabilities. This hands-on experience will enhance your understanding of cybersecurity concepts and best practices.
